The CVE involves a vulnerability in the PHP password_verify() function, which can be exploited by inserting an invalid Blowfish hash into the password database. To assess vulnerability, the PHP version needs to be checked. The process of installing and verifying OpenSSH on Windows 11 was explored to facilitate remote server access for PHP version verification. The next step is to open Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows 11 and execute 'ssh -V' to verify OpenSSH installation, then use SSH to connect to the server and check the PHP version with 'php -v'.\nTask reminder: Verify OpenSSH installation on Windows 11 using 'ssh -V' in Command Prompt or PowerShell, then use SSH to connect to the server and check the PHP version with 'php -v'.", "error": "Error: None"}, {"thought": "Thought: The information provided outlines several methods to open PowerShell on Windows 11, such as using the Start Menu, a keyboard shortcut, or the Task Manager.

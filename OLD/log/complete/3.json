Identify the name of the service or application involved.\n2. Determine the relevant CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) based on the captured data.\n3. Gather evidence of malicious activities associated with the identified CVE.\n4. Assess whether the service or application is vulnerable to the identified attack.\n5. Evaluate whether the attack was successful.\n\nGuidelines:\n- Begin by thoroughly analyzing the PCAP file to extract relevant information.\n- After the PCAP exploration, ensure that the CVE identification is accurate by cross-referencing details from external sources with the evidence found in the PCAP.\n\nThe current PCAP file has 114 packets (frames)\nFrame 1: Ether /

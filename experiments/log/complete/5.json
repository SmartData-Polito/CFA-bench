Identify the name of the service or application involved.\n2. Determine the relevant CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) based on the captured data.\n3. Gather evidence of malicious activities associated with the identified CVE.\n4. Assess whether the service or application is vulnerable to the identified attack.\n5. Evaluate whether the attack was successful.\n\nGuidelines:\n- Begin by thoroughly analyzing the PCAP file to extract relevant information.\n- After the PCAP exploration, ensure that the CVE identification is accurate by cross-referencing details from external sources with the evidence found in the PCAP.\n\nThe current PCAP file has 596 packets (frames)\nFrame 1: Ether / IP / TCP

This is a typical part of the TCP three-way handshake process, confirming that the client is ready to proceed with the connection. The presence of the ACK flag without any data suggests that the client is acknowledging the server's greeting and is likely preparing to send authentication credentials or a request. The next step should be to continue monitoring the subsequent frames to see if the client sends any authentication data or SQL queries, which would provide further evidence of the client's activities and intentions.", "action": "Action: ExtractFrame(frame_number=36)", "observation": "Observation: Frame 36: 271 bytes on wire (2168 bits), 271 bytes captured (2168 bits)\n    Encapsulation type: Ethernet (1)\n    Arrival Time: Sep 25, 2024 14:44:22.567695000 CEST\n    UTC Arrival Time: Sep 25, 2024 12:44:22.567695000 UTC\n    Epoch Arrival Time: 1727268262.567695000\n    [Time shift for this packet: 0.000000000 seconds]\n    [Time delta from previous captured frame: 0.000179000 seconds]\n    [Time delta from previous displayed frame: 0.000000000 seconds]\n    [Time since reference or first frame: 15.420691000 seconds]\n    Frame Number: 36\n    Frame Length: 271 bytes (2168 bits)\n    Capture Length: 271 bytes (2168 bits)\n    [Frame is marked: False]\n    [Frame is ignored: False]\n    [Protocols in frame: eth:ethertype:ip:tcp:mysql]\nEthernet II, Src: 02:42:ac:12:00:03 (02:42:ac:12:00:03), Dst: 02:42:ac:12:00:02 (02:42:ac:12:00:02)\n    Destination: 02:42:ac:12:00:02 (02:42:ac:12:00:02)\n        .... ..1. .... .... .... .... = LG bit: Locally administered address (this is NOT the factory default)\n        .... ...0 .... .... .... .... = IG bit: Individual address (unicast)\n    Source: 02:42:ac:12:00:03 (02:42:ac:12:00:03)\n        .... ..1. .... .... .... .... = LG bit: Locally administered address (this is NOT the factory default)\n        .... ...0 .... .... .... .... = IG bit: Individual address (unicast)\n    Type: IPv4 (0x0800)\n    [Stream index: 0]\nInternet Protocol Version 4, Src: 172.18.0.3, Dst: 172.18.0.2\n    0100 .... = Version: 4\n    .... 0101 = Header Length: 20 bytes (5)\n    Differentiated Services Field: 0x08 (DSCP: Unknown, ECN: Not-ECT)\n        0000 10.. = Differentiated Services Codepoint: Unknown (2)\n        .... ..00 = Explicit Congestion Notification: Not ECN-Capable Transport (0)\n    Total Length: 257\n    Identification: 0x3414 (13332)\n    010. .... = Flags: 0x2, Don't fragment\n        0... .... = Reserved bit: Not set\n        .1.. .... = Don't fragment: Set\n        ..0. .... = More fragments: Not set\n    ...0 0000 0000 0000 = Fragment Offset: 0\n    Time to Live: 64\n    Protocol: TCP (6)\n    Header Checksum: 0xadb1 [validation disabled]\n    [Header checksum status: Unverified]\n    Source Address: 172.18.0.3\n    Destination Address: 172.18.0.2\n    [Stream index: 0]\nTransmission Control Protocol, Src Port: 47598, Dst Port: 3306, Seq: 1, Ack: 79, Len: 205\n    Source Port: 47598\n    Destination Port: 3306\n    [Stream index: 11]\n    [Conversation completeness: Incomplete, DATA (15)]\n        ..0. .... = RST: Absent\n        ...0 .... = FIN: Absent\n        .... 1... = Data: Present\n        .... .1.. = ACK: Present\n        .... ..1. = SYN-ACK: Present\n        .... ...1 = SYN: Present\n        [Completeness Flags: \u00b7\u00b7DASS]\n    [TCP Segment Len: 205]\n    Sequence Number: 1    (relative sequence number)\n    Sequence Number (raw): 2467999621\n    [Next Sequence Number: 206    (relative sequence number)]\n    Acknowledgment Number: 79    (relative ack number)\n    Acknowledgment number (raw): 2514241599\n    1000 .... = Header Length: 32 bytes (8)\n    Flags: 0x018 (PSH, ACK)\n        000. .... .... = Reserved: Not set\n        ...0 .... .... = Accurate ECN: Not set\n        .... 0... .... = Congestion Window Reduced: Not set\n        .... .0.. .... = ECN-Echo: Not set\n        .... ..0. .... = Urgent: Not set\n        .... ...1 .... = Acknowledgment: Set\n        .... .... 1... = Push: Set\n        .... .... .0.. = Reset: Not set\n        .... .... ..0. = Syn: Not set\n        .... .... ...0 = Fin: Not set\n        [TCP Flags: \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7AP\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7]\n    Window: 502\n    [Calculated window size: 64256]\n    [Window size scaling factor: 128]\n    Checksum: 0x591d [unverified]\n    [Checksum Status: Unverified]\n    Urgent Pointer: 0\n    Options: (12 bytes), No-Operation (NOP), No-Operation (NOP), Timestamps\n        TCP Option -

The server responded with RST/ACK packets, rejecting the connection attempts. However, a successful connection was eventually established, as indicated by a SYN-ACK response and subsequent data exchange. The client attempted to log in using the 'root' credentials, which was accepted by the server, as evidenced by an OK packet response. The client then sent a RST packet, abruptly terminating the connection, which could indicate an attempt to exploit a vulnerability or cover up traces of the interaction. The server's MySQL version 5.7.44 is affected by CVE-2023-22078, a vulnerability that allows a high-privileged attacker to cause a denial of service. The client's actions suggest an attempt to exploit this vulnerability, but the server remained operational, as it continued to process new connection requests.\nTask reminder: 1.

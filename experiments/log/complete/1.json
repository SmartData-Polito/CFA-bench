The DNS queries for 'grafana.com' and the TCP connection attempts to the resolved IP address (34.120.177.193) on port 443 (HTTPS) suggest communication with a Grafana server.\n\n2. **CVE Identification**: Based on the context and the Grafana service involvement, potential CVEs such as CVE-2023-2801, CVE-2019-10906, and CVE-2020-28493 are relevant. These CVEs are associated with vulnerabilities in Grafana.\n\n3. **Evidence of Malicious Activities**: The PCAP file shows normal DNS queries and TCP handshake attempts, but no direct evidence of exploitation attempts or malicious activities related to the identified CVEs has been observed so far.\n\n4. **Vulnerability Assessment**: Without evidence of exploitation attempts, it is unclear if the Grafana service is vulnerable to the identified CVEs based solely on the PCAP data.\n\n5. **Attack Success Evaluation**: There is no indication of a successful attack in the analyzed frames.

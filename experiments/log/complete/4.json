XSS vulnerability in update-center2 SECURITY-3063 / CVE-2023-27905 Severity (CVSS): Medium Description: update-center2 is the tool used to generate the Jenkins update sites hosted on updates.jenkins.io. While it is designed for use by the Jenkins project for this purpose, others may be using it to operate their own self-hosted update\nInformation 2: newer version of Jenkins. Custom update site URLs (i.e., not https://updates.jenkins.io/update-center.json) are configured, and those update sites behave differently. We expect that most of these will host a fairly small set of vetted plugins (e.g., an organization\u2019s approved or internal plugins), preventing exploitation through their restrictive inclusion process. Jenkins community update sites no longer publish plugin releases with invalid Jenkins core dependencies since 2023-02-15.

points:\n\n1. **Service/Application Involved**: The service involved is Jenkins, specifically the update service hosted on 'updates.jenkins.io'.\n2. **Relevant CVE**: The relevant CVE identified is CVE-2023-27905, which is an XSS vulnerability in the update-center2 tool used by Jenkins.\n3. **Evidence of Malicious Activities**: The PCAP file shows DNS queries and TCP connections to 'updates.jenkins.io', indicating communication with the Jenkins update server. However, no direct evidence of XSS payloads or exploitation attempts was found in the analyzed frames.\n4. **Vulnerability Assessment**: The presence of communication with 'updates.jenkins.io' suggests that the Jenkins instance may be vulnerable to CVE-2023-27905 if the update-center2 tool is being used.\n5. **Attack Success Evaluation**: There is no conclusive evidence in the analyzed frames to determine if an attack exploiting CVE-2023-27905 was successful. Further analysis of the remaining frames or additional context may be required to make this determination.\nTask reminder: Continue analyzing the remaining frames in the PCAP file to identify any HTTP traffic or requests to 'updates.jenkins.io' that might contain XSS payloads or other unusual patterns indicative of an exploitation attempt.", "error": "Error: None"}, {"thought": "Thought: Frame 11 contains an ACK packet from the client (172.18.0.2) to the Jenkins update server (52.202.51.185), completing the TCP handshake.

The next step is to analyze subsequent frames for any HTTP traffic, such as GET or POST requests, which might contain XSS payloads or other unusual patterns indicative of an exploitation attempt.

update-center2.\n3. **Evidence of Malicious Activity**: The PCAP file shows DNS queries and TCP connections to 'updates.jenkins.io', indicating communication with the Jenkins update server. However, no direct evidence of XSS payloads or exploitation attempts was found in the analyzed frames.\n4. **Vulnerability Assessment**: The presence of communication with 'updates.jenkins.io' suggests potential exposure to CVE-2023-27905, but without evidence of XSS payloads, it's unclear if the service is actively vulnerable.\n5. **Attack Success Evaluation**: There is no conclusive evidence in the analyzed frames to determine if an attack exploiting CVE-2023-27905 was successful.\nTask reminder: Continue analyzing the remaining frames in the PCAP file to identify any HTTP traffic or requests to 'updates.jenkins.io' that might contain XSS payloads or other unusual patterns indicative of an exploitation attempt.", "error": "Error: None"}, {"thought": "Thought: Frame 12 contains a TLS Client Hello message, which is part of the TLS handshake process.
